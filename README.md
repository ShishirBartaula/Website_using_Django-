# Django Learning Project

This repository is part of my journey as a **beginner learning Django**.  
The goal of this project is to understand Django fundamentals by building a small website step by step.

I am currently learning:
- Django basics (models, views, templates, URLs)
- Working with apps and project structure
- Static files and media files
- Django Tailwind integration
- Git and GitHub with Django projects

This project is **not production-ready** and is created only for learning and practice purposes.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
- Django Tailwind
- HTML / CSS
- SQLite (development database)

---

## Notes

-This project is built while learning Django, so the code may not follow best practices yet.
Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
